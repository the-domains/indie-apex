# Start Up Conversations With The Best Song

Over 4 million tracks from Spotify's 20 million song catalog have never been listened to, not even once. Even with the latest music services, platforms, and apps consumers still struggle to uncover and break away from their limited scope of music entangled in the amplifying music universe. Adrien Moret and co-founder Shayne Gredoire recognized the lack of music exploring engines and thus founded The Best Song. What started as a website to vote for your favorite tracks has now evolved into a drop-dead-simple music discovery app. The Best Song turns the overwhelming world of music into a recognizable platform swiping left or right to skip or keep the songs and has been coined the "tinder of music."

After winning a startup acceleration contest and being incubated in France, it took six months for designers and developers to construct the first beta version. From the inception of Adrien's first idea he was "very focused on the user experience." The app has a direct and quick navigation to find new tracks and artists. When opening the app users are greeted with easy options to pick a genre of music, and then simply swipe right to save the track or swipe left to move to the next song. The app is centralized around "adaptive recommendations" as the algorithm learns with each swipe and improves the chances of the next song matching the user's music preferences. Adrien and Shayne have pioneered a taste making musical masterpiece that fits in your pocket.

"It's a very interesting moment for music right now," said Adrien, as the music and technology industries are constantly anticipating what's next and new. Now in 2015, the war of streaming services from Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, Pandora, and others has intensified, as each battle for more market share of the music industry. "I think a lot of strong players still don't know how to react and create the new music industry of the future," said Adrien. The main competitors, Apple and Spotify, have been struggling to create fresh features to aid and entice individuals to discover new music. Apple Music has been heavily promoting their addition of human curated playlists aiming for a personal touch. However, the end result was far from and ended up like a robot spitting out random tracks with a terrible playlist name generator. In contrast, Spotify recently launched a new feature called Discover Weekly that is a weekly mixtape of 30 songs. The final product is easily digestible, but it is too simple and lacks user options and feedback. The discernible predicament is that these services lack an adaptive and effortless music discovery feature, thus hindering users to branch out into unaccustomed artists and music styles.

"We don't want to be a competitor to Apple Music, Spotify, or every other music platform," said Adrien. The Best Song is simply a great companion to these streaming services, and picks up the slack or lack of quality music discovery engines. The music industry would be struggling even further without startups like The Best Song to bridge the gap between music and technology. Adrien said, "we are on the side of the artists, as our mission from the beginning was to help people discover new songs hidden in the vast ocean of music." The Best Song app is now available on all iPhones and Android devices from the app store. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ec594ec-d263-4912-8e29-ebe5abded6ba.png)
